Overview

Simulation Case C extends from case B with a sampled population similar to that of the NBDPS case study population. A total of 10 subpopulations with respective sizes $n_s = (1600,1500,1500,1200,600,1000,1200,1200,1100,900)$ were generated. Each subpopulation was assigned to one local profile, with the exception of subpopulations 4 and 8. These two subpopulations were randomly split between two local profiles each. Global and local patterns were generated as in Cases A and B with an expected modal response probability of 0.85, and 0.05 otherwise. Allocation probability vector to the global level $(Pr(G_{ij}=1|s_i)$ for $s= (1,2,\ldots, 10)$ was defined as (0.7, 0.5,0.6, 0.4, 0.4, 0.6, 0.55, 0.55, 0.7, 0.45). Observed outcome values were generated as in Cases A and B, where $\xi = (0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 0.7, 0.6, 1.4, 0.5, 1, -2, -1)$.
