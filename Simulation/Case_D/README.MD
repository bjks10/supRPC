# Supervised RPC Simulation Case D

Simulation Case D extends from case C with a sampled population similar to that of the NBDPS case study population. A total of 10 subpopulations with respective sizes $n_s = (1600,1500,1500,1200,600,1000,1200,1200,1100,900)$ were generated. Each subpopulation was assigned to one local profile, with the exception of subpopulations 4 and 8. These two subpopulations were randomly split between two local profiles each. Global patterns (Figure \ref{fig:sim_globalABCD}) were randomly assigned with a probability vector of $\pi_{true}= (0.5, 0.4, 0.1)$.  Local patterns (Figure \ref{fig:sim_localC}) were randomly assigned as in Case C. All global and local patterns were generated with an expected modal response probability of 0.85, and 0.05 otherwise. Allocation probability vector to the global level $(Pr(G_{ij}=1|s_i)$ for $s= (1,2,\ldots, 10)$ was defined as in Case C. Observed outcome values were generated as in C, where $\xi = (0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 0.7, 0.6, 1.4, 0.5, 1, -2, -1)$.
